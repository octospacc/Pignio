# Updates from 2025-11-16 (97e19057)

https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/97e190579c029666b83eca9c918adf1987cbe9e7

+ Added proper backend support for creating and saving carousels.
+ Adapted the item creation frontend for current support of carousels.
+ Generally improved the UI/UX feel of the item creation page.
    + Added cards for each media type being saved, allowing for custom enabling/disabling.
+ Improved the HTML preview parsing logic to also support audio, and to check more meta tags.
+ Added an initial comments API.
    + Added a comment editing feature.
+ Fixed search to internally flatten newlines in item metadata to spaces, allowing for searched text to be found even if it spans multiple lines.
+ Text in comments is now parsed as in item descriptions, so everything is correctly linkified.
+ Updated files for freezing via Docker to hopefully now have correct commands.
+ Moved global styles to a dedicated file, with better syntax and comments.

# Updates from 2025-11-14 (87d018b0)

https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/87d018b0703b10398e0a25e45c43bbd8a8680106

+ Added initial support for carousel image items (reading in backend, showing in frontend, with proper lightbox support).
+ Improved search filtering by adding ID to fields, filtering by NSFW status (Any, ON or OFF), and filtering by (one or more) languages.
+ Added new languages to the content tagging list (ελληνικά - Greek, 조선어/한국어 - Korean, Español - Spanish).
+ Added JavaScript to hide the extra Apply button for advanced settings on the search page, as resubmitting the search from the main form is more intuitive.
+ Now export ZIP folders are downloaded to the client efficiently via streaming, instead of hogging memory (with `zipstream-new` library).
+ On folder pages, the download ZIP button is now added to be shown to logged-in users.
+ Added initial proper SEO/social metadata for users, collections and folder pages, which were previously missing.
    + Also generally improved the style of metadata titles.
+ Added initial support for showing custom titles of users and their collections.
+ Added initial files for easily running the freeze script via Docker.
+ Fixed an oversight where the pagination links were not being properly constructed on user pages in secondary modes (Created, All), wrongly going to the default mode (Pinned).

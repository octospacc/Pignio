https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/aea886f7ceaa500da292c1987272eb119dd870f5 - https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/09553c34cf81a33f9a1f4b99539ad56068a5a0a1

+ Improved the freeze script, now including embeds and fixing an error with duplicated media downloads.
+ Initial release of the public HTTP API, with access tokens and brief documentation.
+ Added a page for personal user settings (at `/settings`), initially for managing API tokens.
+ Improved the configuration of the app, making it more structured with an INI file instead of `Config.py`.
+ Added support for creating BAK files on editing of any metadata, providing a failsafe in case of catastrophic failure.

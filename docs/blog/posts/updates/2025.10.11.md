# Updates from 2025-10-11 (873354fc)

https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/873354fc16b10c35aa477fdd16ab1966ebd198f4

+ Added new dedicated tab view modes to all the user pages: "Pinned" (the saved items, default with all collections) and "Created".
+ Added a (private) listing of all personally written comments to a new "Comments" tab in the user pages.
+ Added display of hashtags in item descriptions, as clickable links directing to the search page.
+ Added a selector for choosing (multiple) destination collections directly when creating an item, with the default still being the base profile collection.
+ Slight improvements have been made to the overall layout of the item creation page, by grouping the options more together.
+ Fixed an oversight that would lead to any file being read from user collections directories, leading to (among other possible issues) collections BAK files being read and displayed in the listings.
+ Fixed an issue where HTML escaping was missing in some circumstances, leading to invalid HTML (and XML for Atom feeds) markup.

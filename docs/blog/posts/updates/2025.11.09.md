# Updates from 2025-11-09 (cc79d693)

https://gitlab.com/octospacc/Pignio/-/commit/cc79d6939a5c5ab002a706875a7a077125d1e938

+ A new "All" view was added to user profile pages, showing a full listing of all created and saved items in a single list.
+ To improve the experience of viewing images — especially for artistic usages, like having reference images for drawing — initial support was added for a powerful lightbox, with zoom support on both desktop and mobile, thanks to the SimpleLightbox library.
+ Search is starting to expand, with some initial new features:
    + Turn case-sensitivity ON or OFF;
    + Filter by a specific metadata field instead of only searching in all (currently available: title, description, text, alt text, link);
    + Filter by specific creators usernames.
+ Added a `GET` `/api/v1/items` API endpoint, returning a full listing of all accessible items on the instance.
+ Fixed a bug with static site generation, where it hanged indefinitely at users pages due to an URL filtering oversight. 
+ Add initial support for the multiple user page views in static site generation.

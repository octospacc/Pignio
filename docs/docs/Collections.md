Collections in Pignio, like boards in Pinterest, allow for many items to be grouped together. They are essentially like folders, except user-specific, not dependent on the file system but instead defined by an INI file, and non-exclusive (unlike file folders, an item can be contained in an unlimited number of collections at the same time, or even none at all).

For each user, the profile itself is a collection, considered the default to save newly-created items to, and it corresponds with the user's profile INI file (`/users/<username>.ini`). New collections can be created when wanting to save an item, and they correspond with dedicated INI files inside the user's profile-adjacent folder (`/users/<username>/<collection>.ini`).

Refer to [Types reference#CollectionDict](Types reference.md#_pignio.CollectionDict) for the metadata fields reference.
